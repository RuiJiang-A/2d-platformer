# Simple 2D Platformer in Godot

Welcome to this simple 2D platformer game created using the Godot Engine. This project is designed to showcase the integration of GDExtension with C++. Enjoy navigating through the game with a parallax scrolling background and collect points by gathering collectibles.

## Features

### GDExtension Integration

- Utilizes GDExtension, a Godot-specific technology, allowing the engine to interact with native shared libraries at runtime. This enables the use of native code without the need to compile it with the engine, providing a more dynamic development process.

### Player Controller

- The player can move left and right using the arrow keys (← and →).
- Jump functionality is enabled with the spacebar.
